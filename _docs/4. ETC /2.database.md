CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the fundamental data processing functions that most computer software has. It is also used as a term referring to the functionalities that a user interface should have, such as referencing, searching, and updating information.

Today, we learned how to create a database, add and grant permissions to users, and process CRUD operations using MariaDB.
