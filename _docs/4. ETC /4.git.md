### .gitignore ?

**what's '.gitignore'?**

<div class="content-box">
file or folder list what you don't want to commit in git. 
every single file(folder) would be excluded when you commit. 
ref : https://gitignore.io
</div>

# ~
the line will be annotated by using #
`/folder name`

the folder would be excluded when you commit to git 
`filename.format`

the file would be excluded when you commit to git 
`/folder/file.format`

the path would be excluded when you commit to git 
`/folder/*.format`

those formats in the path would be excluded when you commit to git 
`/folder/\**/*.format`

### The operation principle of GitHub


**Working Directory**
<div class="content-box">
Directory where those files i've been working are contained.
</div>

**Staging Area**
<div class="content-box">
The Staging Area in Git is a buffer where you choose which changes to include in your next commit
</div>

**Local Repository**
<div class="content-box">
The area where the Meta data of Local git project will be saved. 
</div>

**Remote Repository**
<div class="content-box">
A Remote Repository in Git is a version of your project hosted on a server that can be accessed by multiple developers, allowing them to collaborate and synchronize their work.
</div>

### Clone

**Command**
```
$ git clone https://github.com/~~/~.git     //HTTP
$ git clone git@github.com:HyunsooZo/~~.git //SSH
```


### Branch Generation

```
$ git branch feature-branch(branch name)
$ git checkout feature-branch(branch name)
```


### Merge

**Move to the Branch**
```
$ git checkout main
```

**Proceed with merge**
```
$ git merge (branch name)
```


### Conflict 

 conflict in GitHub occurs when changes made to the same lines of code in different branches cannot be merged automatically, and require manual resolution by the user. This typically happens when two people are working on the same code simultaneously and make different changes to the same lines of code. The user must manually review the conflicting changes, decide which changes to keep, and then commit the resolved changes back to the branch.


**Solution**



**Move to the Branch where Conflict occurred**

```
$ git checkout (branch name)
```

**Modify the file caused Conflict (Git will let you know the cause)**

**add the file on Staging Area**

```
$ git add <resolved-file>
```

**Solve all conflicts and commit** 

```
$ git commit -m "Resolved conflicts in <file-name>"
```

**Push to Remote Repository**

```
$ git push origin branch name
```
