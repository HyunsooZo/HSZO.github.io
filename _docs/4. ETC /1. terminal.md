### Terminal Font Customization (bash,zshrc)

As I frequently use the terminal, I found the readability to be poor, so I tried changing the font color of the terminal.

**1. Open '.bash_profile' Using Vim Editer**
```s
vim .bash_profile 
# if zshrc's been being used, then enter `zshrc` instead of `bash`
```
**Enter Insert Mode**
```s
i
```
**3. Enter the Following Codes Once You're in Insert Mode**
```s
export CLICOLOR=1
export LSCOLORS=ExFxCxDxBxegedabagacad
export TERM="xterm-color"
PS1='\[\e[0;33m\]\u\[\e[0m\]@\[\e[0;32m\]\h\[\e[0m\]:\[\e[0;34m\]\w\[\e[0m\]\$'
```

*Press 'esc' once editing is done.*

**4. Save and Quit the Vim Editor**
```s
:wq!
```
